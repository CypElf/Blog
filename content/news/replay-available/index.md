For the occasion of [the event organized by Root-Me](https://www.root-me.org/en/breve/Registration-and-Planning-CTF-Root-Me) to celebrate the 10k members on the discord server, I presented two conferences about cybersecurity topics.

These are now available for replay on Root-Me's YouTube channel. \
⚠️ Warning : they are fully in French.
